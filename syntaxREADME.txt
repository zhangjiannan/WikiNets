To create an arrow between two existing nodes:
  Click to select the source Node.
  TAB [you can then enter a type and key:values for the arrow or leave it blank]
  TAB
  Click to select the target Node. 
  Congrats you've created a new link!

Here's the syntax to create an arrow from the one you have selected (by clicking or searching) to a new node.

(i) Click a node.
(ii) TAB to Focus on the Arrow textbox.
(iii) Type:  
relatesto : This arrow relates an old node to a new one #color red
This syntax gives a new arrow of type relatesto with the key-value dictionary:
{ description: "This arrow relates an old node to a new one", color: "red" }
(iv) Press ENTER or TAB
(v) Type into the (Target) Node textbox syntax for the new target node you want to create, i.e.
New Idea : This is the new idea that I want to draw an arrow to. #size big #color blue
This syntax will give create a node with the key-value dictionary
{ description: "This is the new idea that I want to draw an arrow to.", size: big, color: blue }
(vi) Press ENTER (This will create the new arrow and node).  You need to refresh the page to see it on the viz.

If you want to do all of this starting with a new node instead, then just don't select one to begin with and type the same syntax directly into the Node box.

Anyway don't worry if this is confusing, as I can much more easily show you later if you are interested (and it is changing anyway).
